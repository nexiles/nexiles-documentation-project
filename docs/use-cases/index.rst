Abstract
========
Here we define possible use cases for the solution that has to be developed.

The use cases are based on the different types of users that will use the
service. This means that there are use cases for developers, administrators,
consultants and end users. Consultants and end users only access documentation
with the doc app whereas developers must push documentation to the service in
a programmatic way and administrators use the website for the management of
users and documentation.
