==================================

Description
===========

A customer of Nexiles wants to view the documentation for a product he uses.

Actors
======

**Fred**
    A Nexiles developer that just finished a new release.

**Anton**
    A customer working at his office with internet access.

Rationale
=========

The doc app can be used by end-users to find tutorials and documentation for their products. When new versions of these products become available the user must have access to the new documentation, too. The user must be given the choice to download the new version.

Preconditions
=============

- The app must have access to the internet.
- Fred must have pushed a new version of the documentation accessed by Anton to the web service.
- Fred or another administrator of the web service must have granted Anton's company the permission to view this documentation.
- The app that Anton uses must have stored the right login credentials for his company.

Invariants
==========

- Older versions of the same project stored in the app must not be overwritten.

Postcondition
=============

- The HTML files and the zip file must be stored in a new subdirectory for the new version.
- The new version of the documentation must be viewable.
- The new version has the same icon as the other documents.

Normal Flow
===========

From the nexiles|starter Anton opens the doc app which shows all released documentation that is available for his company. He clicks on a documentation that Fred has published some time ago and receives a message saying that a new version of the documentation is available. He has the option to download the new version or continue opening the old one. He chooses to download the new documentation. A small progress bar shows that the download has started. When the download finishes the new documentation opens up in a new tab. The new documentation looks the same as the old one but some new parts of documentation are added to the document.

Notes
=====

- The end-user has only access to public documentation and documentation that a Nexiles administrator has granted the customer access to.
